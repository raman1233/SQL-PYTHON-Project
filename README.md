## Key Insights

* **Customer Distribution:** The project analyzed customer distribution by state, revealing that SÃ£o Paulo (SP) has a significantly larger customer base compared to other states in Brazil. [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
* **Order Trends:** Analysis of 2018 order trends showed a consistent number of orders in the first half of the year, followed by a decline starting in August. [cite: 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]
* **Payment Installments:** A large percentage (99.99%) of payments involved installments, indicating the popularity of this payment method among customers. [cite: 17]
* **Revenue by Category:** 'BED TABLE BATH' and 'FURNITURE DECORATION' are among the top revenue-generating product categories, while 'INSURANCE AND SERVICES' and 'FASHION CHILDREN'S CLOTHING' show significantly lower sales. [cite: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 36, 37]

* **Customer Spending:** Moving average analysis was used to examine customer spending habits over time. [cite: 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]

## SQL Queries & Python Implementation

* The project uses SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the database. [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 40]
* Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. [cite: 4, 5, 6, 7]
